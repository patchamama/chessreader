# ♞ ChessReader

> **Turn any chess book, EPUB or website into an interactive reading experience.**

ChessReader parses chess content — EPUBs, public URLs, plain text — recognises move notation in Spanish and English, builds a full game tree, and lets you step through every move on a live board with Stockfish evaluation. A companion browser extension brings the same experience to any chess blog you visit.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```

├── apps/
│   ├── api/          # PHP 8.5 · Slim 4 · Clean Architecture (Domain / Application / Infrastructure)
│   ├── web/          # React 19 · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS
│   └── extension/    # MV3 Browser Extension (Chrome / Edge)
└── packages/
    └── chess-shared/ # Shared TypeScript: move recognition, GameTree, PGN parser
```

The frontend and extension share the `chess-shared` package. The API is a standalone Slim 4 app following Hexagonal Architecture — domain logic is framework-agnostic and fully tested.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Min version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| PHP | 8.1 | [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads) |
| Composer | 2 | [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org) |
| Node.js | 18 | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| pnpm | 8 | `npm i -g pnpm` |
| Git | any | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |

### macOS / Linux — one command

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patchamama/chessreader/main/install.sh | bash
```

This clones the repo into `./chessreader`, installs all dependencies, then prints instructions to start.

### Windows — one command

```bat
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patchamama/chessreader/main/install.bat -o install.bat && install.bat
```

### Manual install

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/patchamama/chessreader.git
cd chessreader

# 2. Install dependencies
composer install --working-dir=apps/api
pnpm install

# 3. Start
bash start.sh          # macOS / Linux
start.bat              # Windows
```

### Start

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash start.sh

# Windows
start.bat
```

The stack starts on:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| **Web app** | http://127.0.0.1:5173 |
| **API** | http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health |

> **Dev mode:** on `localhost` login is optional — you get full admin access automatically. A "dev mode" badge appears in the header.

### Environment overrides

```bash
API_PORT=9000 WEB_PORT=4000 ADMIN_EMAIL=me@example.com ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret bash start.sh
```

## 📖 Usage

### Library
Upload an EPUB or a book URL → chapters appear in the library. Open a chapter and click any chess move to advance the board.

### Web Parser
Go to **Webparser**, paste a URL (e.g. a chess blog post) and ChessReader fetches the page, detects all games, and renders them inline with interactive boards. Switch between **Normal** (HTML as-is) and **Substitution** (diagram images replaced by live boards) modes.

### Browser Extension
Load the unpacked extension from `apps/extension/` in Chrome (`chrome://extensions → Load unpacked`). Visit any chess site — the extension detects diagrams and game notation and makes them interactive.

### Admin Panel
Visit `/admin` to approve or reject pending user accounts.
